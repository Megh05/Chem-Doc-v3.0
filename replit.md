# ChemDoc AI - Document Processing System

## Overview

ChemDoc AI is a sophisticated document processing application that automates the extraction and transformation of chemical data from supplier documents. The system uses AI-powered OCR and data extraction to convert supplier certificates of analysis (CoA), technical data sheets (TDS), and material data management sheets (MDMS) into standardized company formats. Built with React, Express, and Drizzle ORM, it provides a complete workflow from document upload through AI processing to final document generation.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## Recent Changes

**Migration Completed (2025-08-26):**
- Successfully migrated ChemDoc AI from Replit Agent to standard Replit environment
- Fixed critical data extraction issue where template placeholders were showing instead of actual extracted values
- Implemented data normalization function to map corrupted field names from AI extraction to clean template field names
- Enhanced AI prompt engineering to ensure proper field name consistency
- All core functionality verified and working: document upload, template selection, OCR processing, data extraction, and template preview
- Application running cleanly on port 5000 with proper client/server separation
