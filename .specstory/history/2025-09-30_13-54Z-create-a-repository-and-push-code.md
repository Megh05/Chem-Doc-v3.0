<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Planning git repository setup**

I need to create a git repository and push it. First, I can run `git init`, and I should also create the repo on GitHub, which may require authentication. I’ll propose commands, and I see that I can use run_terminal_cmd to execute them. I need the remote URL, so I'll ask the user for their GitHub username and repo name or use the gh CLI if it's available. I'll write a todo list to plan these steps and ensure I create a .gitignore for the existing node project.
**Creating the repository**

The task is to create a repository and push it. I’ll do this by running minimal commands: `git init`, `add`, `commit`, and then create the remote on GitHub using `gh repo create`. If `gh` isn't configured, I’ll prompt for assistance. I should provide status updates before each command and ensure that the commands run sequentially since later steps depend on earlier ones. I’ll create a todo list for tasks like initializing the repo and adding a .gitignore. It’s important to ask the user for their GitHub username to ensure everything aligns correctly.
**Generating the repository**

I see that I should run `gh repo create` without specifying an owner, which allows it to create under the authenticated user. This would look like `gh repo create Chem-Doc-v3.0-main --private --source=. --remote=origin --push`. That should work if `gh` is installed and authenticated, but if it fails, the tool will return an error. First things first, I’ll create a .gitignore file and generate a typical Node+Vite ignore through a terminal command using `printf`. Let’s move ahead!</details></think>

I'll initialize a new git repository, add a proper .gitignore, make the initial commit, create a remote repository on your GitHub account using the GitHub CLI, and push the code. If the GitHub CLI isn't installed or authenticated, I'll report the error so we can adjust.
